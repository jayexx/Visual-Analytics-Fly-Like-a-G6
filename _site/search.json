This overlap in title_ID affects 6 title_IDs, spreads across 6 knowledge areas and 7 sub-knowledge areas.\nThe unique values for knowledge and sub-knowledge areas are obtained in the following code chunk to better understand the complexity of these 2 variables.\n\nunique(df_TitleInfo$knowledge)\n\n[1] \"r8S3g\" \"t5V9e\" \"m3D1v\" \"y9W5d\" \"k4W1c\" \"s8Y2f\" \"g7R2j\" \"b3C9s\"\n\nunique(df_TitleInfo$sub_knowledge)\n\n [1] \"r8S3g_l0p5viby\" \"r8S3g_n0m9rsw4\" \"t5V9e_e1k6cixp\" \"m3D1v_r1d7fr3l\"\n [5] \"m3D1v_v3d9is1x\" \"m3D1v_t0v5ts9h\" \"y9W5d_c0w4mj5h\" \"k4W1c_h5r6nux7\"\n [9] \"s8Y2f_v4x8by9j\" \"y9W5d_p8g6dgtv\" \"y9W5d_e2j7p95s\" \"g7R2j_e0v1yls8\"\n[13] \"g7R2j_j1g8gd3v\" \"b3C9s_l4z6od7y\" \"b3C9s_j0v1yls8\"\n\n\nBased on the output above, there is a total of 8 knowledge areas and 15 sub-knowledge areas. This suggests that majority of the knowledge areas and approximately half of sub-knowledge areas have overlapping title_ID. From the nomenclature, each sub-knowledge area is tagged to only 1 knowledge area.\nTo meaningfully analyse the relationship between knowledge areas & sub knowledge areas and other variables, additional columns are introduced where the values in these 2 columns are transposed as column labels with binary values to indicate the tagging of each question to that value.

    "text": "Methodology\nOur methodology systematically integrates data collection, data processing, analysis, pattern mining, modeling, and recommendations to create a comprehensive Visual Analytics solution for improving teaching strategies and course designs at NorthClass Institute, elaborated below.\n\nKey Data Preparation\nData preprocessing and cleaning is required at the initial phase to ensure usability and consistency of the data records for subsequent data analysis. Based on initial assessment of the datasets, the Key Data preparation steps required are as follows.\n\nRemove duplicates, handle missing values through imputation or deletion, and correct inconsistencies.\nCorrecting data type and addressing out-liers.\nCreate new relevant attributes if needed.\nMerging of Multiple datasets in Dataset 3 into a single continuous dataframe, and subsequently joining Datasets 1 and 2 with 3.\n\n\n\nKey DataViz\nTo address the aforesaid requirements, the following methodologies will be considered for the data visualisation (DataViz).\n\nFor task 1, the analysis of answering behaviors involves identifying key performance metrics such as average scores, answer correctness, and time correlations to evaluate learners’ understanding and application of knowledge. Descriptive statistics will be used to compute mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types. Histograms, violin and box plots could be used to visualize score distributions. Performance metrics could be calculated such as accuracy rate, average attempts per question, and time efficiency. These statistical analysis and visualisations will be done in tandem with the classification of questions, to finally visualise and quantify mastery and weaknesses in the various knowledge areas.\nFor task 2, learning behavior patterns involve analyzing habitual actions. Time-series analysis will be used to identify peak answering times. And by studying the frequency and performance of different question types with bar charts, the preferred question type can also be identified. To profile and segment the learner groups, clustering analysis algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can be used based on features engineered from the aforementioned behavior patterns and preferences.\nFor task 3, in modeling the relationship between knowledge acquisition and learning modes, feature selection may build upon analysis from task 1 for knowledge acquisition and task 2 for learning modes. Correlation and Association analysis can then be used to ascertain the statistical significance of the relationships if any.\nFor task 4, to identify question difficulty and learner knowledge levels, questions and learners can be ranked and categorized based on the historical performance data, and thresholds can be defined to sort and bin the data into levels. Cross-comparison can thus be done to filter and analyze data to detect inappropriate questions that are too difficult based on learner performance. An alternative group of inappropriate questions can also be suggested through visualising questions that ‘weak’ learners scored better and/or questions that ‘strong’ learners scored worse.\nLast but not least for task 5, based on the insights gleaned, actionable recommendations will be derived, (such as optimizing the question bank, customizing knowledge delivery based on learning patterns and preferences) aiming to enhance the overall quality of teaching and learning.\n\nAccordingly, a summary of the envisioned DataViz for this project will be as as follows.\n\nGeneral Analysis (for Task 1):\n\nBar plot for mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types.\nBar plot for classifying answers into correct and incorrect categories.\nScatter plot for time vs. Correctness\nFacet plots to visualise multiple plots in a single space\n\nScore distribution and performance metrics (for Tasks 1 & 4): \n\nHistogram for score distribution, bar plot for accuracy rate\nFacet, Ridgeline or Raindrop plots for performance metrics and to compare distribution for various categories\n\nPeaking hours analysis (for Task 2):\n\nTime line chart: Displays the number of activities at different time points in a day to help identify peak hours.\nHeat map: Displays the distribution of daily or weekly activities to help discover high-frequency activities in a specific time period.\n\nClustering result display (for Task 2 & 3):\n\nRadar chart: Displays multiple dimensional features of each cluster.\nBox plot: Displays the distribution of each cluster to understand the differences of clusters.\n\nAssociation and Correlation Analysis (for Task 3 & 4):\n\nScatter plot with best-fit line/curve and shaded area for significance level using ggscaterstats for single numerical independent variable and dependent variable\nMultiple Violin plots using ggbetweenstats for multiple categorical independent variables and numerical independent variable"

Fundamentally, the project’s raison d’etre is to provide actionable insights towards the institution’s endeavor to diagnose and analyze learners’ knowledge mastery levels, monitor the trends in their learning behaviors, identify and dissect potential factors that contribute to learning difficulties, and hence to derive feasible suggestions to adjust teaching strategies and course design.\nTo this end, data was collected from a select group of learners over a specified set of programming tasks over a particular learning period to facilitate the design and implementation of a Visual Analytics solution as a key outcome in this project.\n\n\n\nFrom the Challenge, the key problem statement was to perform a comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets that describe various aspects of the learner’s profile, learning patterns and status, to derive key insights to enhance teaching strategies and course design.\nConsequently the key requirements based on the 5 stipulated tasks in the challenge were as follows.\n\nTask 1: To provide a quantitative assessment of the learners’ knowledge mastery and identify weak links in their knowledge system, based on the multi-dimensional attributes such as answer scores and answer status in the learners’ log records of the learners’ question-answering behaviors.\n\nThis would entail an analysis of the learners’ aggregate performance in their programming tasks (a.k.a. questions in the dataset), including measures of central tendency, or any notable patterns that can glean insights towards knowledge mastery and weaknesses from the given datasets\n\nTask 2: To design and present learners’ profiles, based on learners’ personalized learning behavior patterns (including peak answering hours, preferred question types, correct answering rates, etc.), and various other attributes and characteristics\n\nThis would entail an analysis and profiling of of learners’ behaviours and attributes based on statistically significant patterns that are observed across the variables in the given datasets\n\nTask 3: To analyse and provide a visual representation of the relationship between learning modes and knowledge acquisition (learners’ ability to absorb, integrate, and apply knowledge)\n\nThis would entail an analysis to uncover the various learning modes and the patterns and/or correlations that it may have with the learners’ performance in the questions from the given datasets\n\nTask 4: To analyse the difficulty level of questions and learner’s level of knowledge (which should mostly align) and also to identify ‘inappropriate questions’ that may not align to this relationship.\n\nThis would entail an analysis and comparison between the learners’ performance in each question and the learners’ performance ranking, and hence to identify any potential outliers that violate the alignment of question difficulty and learner’s level of knowledge\n\nTask 5: To offer valuable recommendations to optimize question bank content settings and enhance the quality of teaching and learning, based on the outcomes of the aforementioned analysis of Tasks 1 to 4 above.\n\nThis would entail deriving actionable recommendations based on the insights gleaned in the visual analytics of the datasets from tasks 1 to 4 above"

    "text": "Methodology\nOur methodology systematically integrates data collection, data processing, analysis, pattern mining, modeling, and recommendations to create a comprehensive Visual Analytics solution for improving teaching strategies and course designs at NorthClass Institute, elaborated below.\n\nKey Data Preparation\nData preprocessing and cleaning is required at the initial phase to ensure usability and consistency of the data records for subsequent data analysis. Based on initial assessment of the datasets, the Key Data preparation steps required are as follows.\n\nRemove duplicates, handle missing values through imputation or deletion, and correct inconsistencies.\nCorrecting data type and addressing out-liers.\nCreate new relevant attributes if needed.\nMerging of Multiple datasets in Dataset 3 into a single continuous dataframe, and subsequently joining Datasets 1 and 2 with 3.\n\n\n\nKey DataViz\nTo address the aforesaid requirements, the following methodologies will be considered for the data visualisation (DataViz).\n\nFor task 1, the analysis of answering behaviors involves identifying key performance metrics such as average scores, answer correctness, and time correlations to evaluate learners’ understanding and application of knowledge. Descriptive statistics will be used to compute mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types. Histograms, violin and box plots could be used to visualize score distributions. Performance metrics could be calculated such as accuracy rate, average attempts per question, and time efficiency. These statistical analysis and visualisations will be done in tandem with the classification of questions, to finally visualise and quantify mastery and weaknesses in the various knowledge areas.\nFor task 2, learning behavior patterns involve analyzing habitual actions. Time-series analysis will be used to identify peak answering times. And by studying the frequency and performance of different question types with bar charts, the preferred question type can also be identified. To profile and segment the learner groups, clustering analysis algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can be used based on features engineered from the aforementioned behavior patterns and preferences.\nFor task 3, in modeling the relationship between knowledge acquisition and learning modes, feature selection may build upon analysis from task 1 for knowledge acquisition and task 2 for learning modes. Correlation and Association analysis can then be used to ascertain the statistical significance of the relationships if any.\nFor task 4, to identify question difficulty and learner knowledge levels, questions and learners can be ranked and categorized based on the historical performance data, and thresholds can be defined to sort and bin the data into levels. Cross-comparison can thus be done to filter and analyze data to detect inappropriate questions that are too difficult based on learner performance. An alternative group of inappropriate questions can also be suggested through visualising questions that ‘weak’ learners scored better and/or questions that ‘strong’ learners scored worse.\nLast but not least for task 5, based on the insights gleaned, actionable recommendations will be derived, (such as optimizing the question bank, customizing knowledge delivery based on learning patterns and preferences) aiming to enhance the overall quality of teaching and learning.\n\nAccordingly, a summary of the envisioned DataViz for this project will be as as follows.\n\nGeneral Analysis (for Task 1):\n\nBar plot for mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types.\nBar plot for classifying answers into correct and incorrect categories.\nScatter plot for time vs. Correctness\nFacet plots to visualise multiple plots in a single space\n\nScore distribution and performance metrics (for Tasks 1 & 4): \n\nHistogram for score distribution, bar plot for accuracy rate\nFacet, Ridgeline or Raindrop plots for performance metrics and to compare distribution for various categories\n\nPeaking hours analysis (for Task 2):\n\nTime line chart: Displays the number of activities at different time points in a day to help identify peak hours.\nHeat map: Displays the distribution of daily or weekly activities to help discover high-frequency activities in a specific time period.\n\nClustering result display (for Task 2 & 3):\n\nRadar chart: Displays multiple dimensional features of each cluster.\nBox plot: Displays the distribution of each cluster to understand the differences of clusters.\n\nAssociation and Correlation Analysis (for Task 3 & 4):\n\nScatter plot with best-fit line/curve and shaded area for significance level using ggscaterstats for single numerical independent variable and dependent variable\nMultiple Violin plots using ggbetweenstats for multiple categorical independent variables and numerical independent variable"
