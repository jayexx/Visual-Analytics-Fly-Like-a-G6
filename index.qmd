NorthClass, a prominent higher education training institution, offers over 100 courses across various disciplines, attracting around 300,000 registered learners. The institution collects temporal learning data to assess instructional quality. To optimize teaching resources and improve quality, NorthClass plans to establish a Smart Education Development and Innovation Group. This group will explore the use of next-generation AI technology to cultivate innovative talents.

As a member of the Smart Education Development and Innovation Group, your task is to design and implement a Visual Analytics solution. This solution should help the institution intuitively perceive learners' learning status and provide actionable suggestions for adjusting teaching strategies and course designs. Here are the tasks:

-   Analyze the log records of learners' question-answering behaviors, quantitatively assess the degree of knowledge mastery based on multi-dimensional attributes such as answer scores and answer status, and identify weak links in their knowledge system. (It is recommended that participants answer this question with no more than 800 words and no more than 5 pictures)

-   Mine personalized learning behavior patterns based on learners' characteristics, and design and present learners' profiles from various perspectives, including peak answering hours, preferred question types, correct answering rates, etc. (It is recommended that participants answer this question with no more than 800 words and 5 pictures)

-   Different learning modes directly impact learners' ability to absorb, integrate, and apply knowledge. Efficient learning modes can enhance deep understanding and long-term memory retention of knowledge. Please model the potential relationship between learning modes and knowledge acquisition, present the results in the form of a graph, and provide a brief analysis. (It is recommended that participants answer this question with no more than 800 words and 5 pictures)

-   The difficulty level of questions should align with the learner's level of knowledge. When a learner possesses a high level of knowledge but achieves a low percentage of correct answers, it indicates that the question's difficulty exceeds their ability. Please utilize Visual Analytics to identify these inappropriate questions. (It is recommended that participants answer this question with no more than 800 words and no more than 5 pictures)

-   Based on the outcomes of the aforementioned analysis, it is crucial to offer valuable recommendations for topic designers and course managers to optimize question bank content settings and enhance the quality of teaching and learning. Please briefly explain the rationale behind these suggestions. (It is recommended that participants answer this question with no more than 800 words and 3 pictures)
